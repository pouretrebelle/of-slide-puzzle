# Slide Puzzle in openFrameworks

An MA assignment using the [ofVideoGrabber](http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/video/ofVideoGrabber/) class.

To compile it needs to be inside the `myApps` folder of your openFrameworks installation. Built with MS Visual Studio but can be replicated in a fresh XCode project (created by the project generator) by copying the `src` folder.
